<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello, my name is Ashish bhat.<br/> I hold a Bachelor of Engineering in Computer Science, and I recently completed a 4-month internship in Data Science at Excellence Technology Mohali. During this internship, I had the opportunity to work on various data analysis projects, develop machine learning models, and gain hands-on experience with data visualization tools. 

  I consider my strengths to be my hard-working nature and adaptability, which have enabled me to thrive in fast-paced and dynamic environments. I am committed to continuous learning and growth, and I am proactive in seeking out new challenges to further develop my skills. 
  
  One area I am actively working to improve is my tendency to rush through tasks to meet deadlines, which can occasionally lead to minor errors. To address this, I am focusing on enhancing my attention to detail and time management skills. I believe this approach will help me deliver more accurate and high-quality work.
  
  I am excited about the opportunity to contribute to your team and leverage my skills to drive impactful results.</p>
  <p>Thnak you !</p>
