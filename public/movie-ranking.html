   in this movie toney stark gave his
   ai specticals to peter and the ai was
   used in the spects is <b>"EDITH"</b>
</p>
<h3>Spiderman: No way home</h3>
<p>
   This movie is also a great movie,
   in this movie spiderman want help form
   Dr. Strange which is also a marvel character
   who knows magic, Spiderman wants that
   everyone will forget the reality of the 
   spiderman expect some people who are very
   close to him, but due to this doors of 
   multiverse and normal word get connected
   due to which other spiderman and their 
   villan came in the world of Soider man
